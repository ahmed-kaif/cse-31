\section{Introduction}
The web application brings to life a machine learning framework developed
for the non-invasive detection of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV),
as outlined in our recent research. Designed with accessibility and accuracy in mind,
the platform allows users—particularly patients and healthcare providers—to
upload standard laboratory data and receive predictions about the possible stage
of HCV infection: healthy, hepatitis, fibrosis, or cirrhosis.

The primary objective of the application is to make early and accurate
HCV detection more accessible, especially in low-resource settings where traditional
diagnostic methods are often invasive, costly, and difficult to access.
By leveraging routine blood test results and state-of-the-art machine learning
techniques—including synthetic data generation, feature selection,
and explainable AI—this application aims to provide reliable, interpretable
predictions that can assist in timely clinical decision-making.

This system addresses a critical gap in healthcare: the lack of affordable
and scalable tools for multiclass liver disease classification.
Whether you're a clinician, researcher, or concerned individual,
this platform empowers you with actionable insights using only non-invasive lab data.
